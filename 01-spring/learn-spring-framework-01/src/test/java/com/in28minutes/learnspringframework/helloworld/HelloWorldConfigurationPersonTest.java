================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The code exposes sensitive information, such as a person's name and address. This could potentially lead to privacy violations.
Solution: Avoid storing sensitive information in plain text. Use encryption to secure sensitive data and limit access to this data.

Vulnerability: CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt
Issue: If the person's data is stored in a database and the application is compromised, attackers can use precomputed tables (rainbow tables) to reverse the hashes and obtain the original information.
Solution: Use a unique salt value for each user when hashing their data. This makes precomputed tables useless and significantly improves the security of stored data.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: If the person's data is passed as query strings in a GET request, it will be logged in server logs, browser history, and potential third-party analytics, leading to potential information exposure.
Solution: Use POST requests instead of GET for sending sensitive data, or better yet, use secure methods like HTTPS with proper encryption.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The application exposes information about its internal workings, such as class names and libraries used, which can be useful for attackers.
Solution: Minimize the amount of information exposed by the application. Where possible, obfuscate application details to make it harder for attackers to understand the application's internal workings.

  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrange is required as the method does not take any parameters.
    Act: Invoke the person() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned Person object's name with "Ravi".
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the Person object has the correct name. This test is important in ensuring that the person() method is assigning the correct name to the Person object.

  Scenario 3: Test for Correct Person Age

  Details:  
    TestName: testPersonAge
    Description: This test is meant to check that the Person object created has the correct age.
  Execution:
