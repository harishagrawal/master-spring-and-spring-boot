================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
Issue: The method person3Parameters takes a String, an int, and an Address object as parameters. If these inputs are supplied from an untrusted source, they may contain malicious data that can lead to security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize inputs before using them. Use regular expressions to enforce strong input validation.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The method person3Parameters creates a new Person object which may contain sensitive information. If this object is not properly managed, it could lead to exposure of sensitive information.
Solution: Ensure that the Person object is only accessible to authorized users. Use access control mechanisms to limit access to sensitive information.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The commented out code in the method person3Parameters suggests that this might be left over from debugging. If debug code is left in production, it can expose sensitive information or functionality.
Solution: Always remove debug code before deploying to production. Use logging frameworks to manage debug information.

"""
Scenario 1: Valid Person Object Creation

Details:  
  TestName: testValidPersonCreation
  Description: This test is meant to check whether a valid Person object is created when all parameters are provided correctly. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid Address object and pass it along with a valid name and age to the method.
  Act: Invoke the person3Parameters method with the name, age, and address.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned Person object is not null and that its fields match the parameters.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly creates a Person object when provided with valid parameters. This test is significant in ensuring that the basic functionality of the method works properly.

Scenario 2: Null Name Parameter

Details:  
  TestName: testNullNameParameter
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the method when the name parameter is null. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid Address object and pass it along with a null name and a valid age to the method.
  Act: Invoke the person3Parameters method with null name, valid age, and address.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned Person object's name field is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method can handle a null name parameter. This test is significant in ensuring that the method can handle edge cases.

Scenario 3: Negative Age Parameter

Details:  
  TestName: testNegativeAgeParameter
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the method when the age parameter is negative. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid Address object and pass it along with a valid name and a negative age to the method.
  Act: Invoke the person3Parameters method with a valid name, negative age, and address.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned Person object's age field is negative.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method can handle a negative age parameter. This test is significant in ensuring that the method can handle edge cases.

Scenario 4: Null Address Parameter

Details:  
  TestName: testNullAddressParameter
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the method when the address parameter is null. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Pass a valid name and age along with a null address to the method.
  Act: Invoke the person3Parameters method with a valid name, age and null address.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned Person object's address field is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method can handle a null address parameter. This test is significant in ensuring that the method can handle edge cases. 

Scenario 5: All Parameters Null

Details:  
  TestName: testAllParametersNull
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the method when all parameters are null. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Pass null for the name, age and address to the method.
  Act: Invoke the person3Parameters method with null parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned Person object's fields are all null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method can handle all parameters being null. This test is significant in ensuring that the method can handle edge cases.
