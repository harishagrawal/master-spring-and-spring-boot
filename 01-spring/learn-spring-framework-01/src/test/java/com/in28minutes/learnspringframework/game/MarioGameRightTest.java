ROOST_METHOD_HASH=right_a65de673dd
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=right_db5b14f884
Scenario 1: Test right method
Details:
  TestName: testRight
  Description: Verify that the right method executes the code block inside it without any exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Call the right method.
  Assert: N/A
Validation:
  This test ensures that the right method can be called without any issues. It checks the execution of the print statement "Accelerate".
Scenario 2: Test right method with multiple invocations
Details:
  TestName: testRightMultipleInvocations
  Description: Verify that the right method executes the code block inside it multiple times without any exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Call the right method multiple times.
  Assert: N/A
Validation:
  This test ensures that the right method can be called multiple times without any issues. It checks the execution of the print statement "Accelerate" each time.
Scenario 3: Test right method with logging changes
Details:
  TestName: testRightWithLoggingChanges
  Description: Verify that the right method executes the code block inside it and logs the "Accelerate" statement instead of printing it.
Execution:
  Arrange: Modify the logging configuration to write the logs to a specific file.
  Act: Call the right method.
  Assert: N/A
Validation:
  This test ensures that the right method can be used with different logging configurations. It checks if the "Accelerate" statement is properly logged instead of being printed.
Scenario 4: Test right method with different log levels
Details:
  TestName: testRightWithDifferentLogLevels
  Description: Verify that the right method executes the code block inside it and logs the "Accelerate" statement with different log levels.
Execution:
  Arrange: Modify the logging configuration to set different log levels.
  Act: Call the right method.
  Assert: N/A
Validation:
  This test ensures that the right method can be used with different log levels. It checks if the "Accelerate" statement is properly logged with the expected log levels.
Scenario 5: Test right method in a multithreaded environment
Details:
  TestName: testRightMultithreaded
  Description: Verify that the right method can be safely called from multiple threads simultaneously without any issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple threads and make each thread call the right method simultaneously.
  Act: Start all the threads and wait for them to complete.
  Assert: N/A
Validation:
  This test ensures that the right method can be safely used in a multithreaded environment. It checks if all threads can execute the code block inside the right method without any issues or conflicts.
