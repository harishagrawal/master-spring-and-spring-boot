================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The Address object is public and can be accessed from outside the class. This can lead to unintended information exposure.
Solution: Make the Address object private and provide public getter and setter methods to access and modify the data.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: If the Address object is used in HTTP GET request, sensitive data can be exposed through URL.
Solution: Avoid using sensitive data in GET request. Use POST request instead where data is sent in the body of the request.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The Address object contains sensitive personal information. If not handled properly, it could lead to privacy violation.
Solution: Ensure proper access control mechanisms are in place. Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.

Vulnerability: CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
Issue: The Address data is not encrypted, which could be a problem if the data is sensitive and needs to be protected.
Solution: Encrypt sensitive data using appropriate encryption methods before storing or transmitting.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to check if the method returns the correct address object.

Details:
  TestName: testAddress3ReturnsCorrectObject.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method 'address3' returns the correct address object with the given details.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as the method doesn't take any arguments.
  Act: Invoke the method 'address3'.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned object is an instance of the Address class and if its fields match the given details "Motinagar" and "Hyderabad".
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method returns the correct address object. The test's significance lies in ensuring the method's functionality in creating and returning the correct address object.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the method returns a new address object each time it is invoked.

Details:
  TestName: testAddress3ReturnsNewObject.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method 'address3' returns a new address object each time it is invoked.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as the method doesn't take any arguments.
  Act: Invoke the method 'address3' twice.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the two returned objects are not the same (using '!=' operator).
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method returns a new object each time it is invoked. This is important for ensuring that different invocations of the method do not interfere with each other.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the method sets the correct fields in the address object.

Details:
  TestName: testAddress3SetsCorrectFields.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method 'address3' sets the correct fields in the address object.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as the method doesn't take any arguments.
  Act: Invoke the method 'address3'.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned object's fields match the given details "Motinagar" and "Hyderabad".
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method sets the correct fields in the address object. This test is significant for ensuring that the method correctly creates the address object with the given details.
