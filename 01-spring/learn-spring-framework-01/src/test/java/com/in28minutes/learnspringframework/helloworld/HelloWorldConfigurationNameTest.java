================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The 'name()' method returns a static string 'Ranga'. If this is used in a GET request, it could potentially expose sensitive information.
Solution: Avoid sending sensitive information through GET requests. If it is necessary, use POST requests instead, or encrypt the data before sending.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The 'name()' method seems to be a debug method that returns a static value. If left in production code, it can lead to information exposure and other unintended behavior.
Solution: Ensure that debug code is properly separated from production code, preferably using a different build configuration or a feature toggle.

Vulnerability: CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference ('XXE')
Issue: The code imports several Spring Framework libraries, which may be used to parse XML. If not properly configured, this can lead to an XXE vulnerability.
Solution: Ensure that XML parsing is configured to disallow the use of external entities. This can usually be done through parser configuration or by using a library that disallows them by default.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to validate the output of the name() method

Details:  
  TestName: testNameOutput
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method name() returns the expected String "Ranga". 

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the name() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result "Ranga" against the expected output "Ranga".

Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method returns the correct string. The expected result is "Ranga" since this is hardcoded in the method. The test is significant as it checks the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test to validate the type of return value from the name() method

Details:  
  TestName: testNameReturnType
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method name() returns a value of type String. 

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the name() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is an instance of type String.

Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method returns a value of type String. This is based on the method signature which specifies that the return type should be String. The test is significant as it ensures the method is returning the correct type of value.

Scenario 3: Test to validate the length of the return value from the name() method

Details:  
  TestName: testNameLength
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method name() returns a String of length 5. 

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the name() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the length of the returned string against the expected length 5.

Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method returns a string of correct length. The expected length is 5, which is the length of "Ranga". This test is significant as it ensures that the returned string is not altered in length.
