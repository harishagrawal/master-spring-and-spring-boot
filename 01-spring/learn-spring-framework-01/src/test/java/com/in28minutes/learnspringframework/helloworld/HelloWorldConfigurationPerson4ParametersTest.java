================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) or CWE-639
Issue: The function person4Parameters accepts parameters directly and uses them to create a new Person object. If the parameters are coming from an untrusted source, this could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of data.
Solution: Validate and sanitize all input parameters. Consider implementing access controls to ensure that a user can only access data they are authorized to.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The function person4Parameters might be exposing sensitive information like name, age, and address. If this information is not handled properly, it can lead to privacy violations.
Solution: Consider anonymizing data or using pseudonyms instead of real data. Ensure that sensitive data is encrypted during storage and transmission.

Vulnerability: CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
Issue: The public method person4Parameters is exposed and can be accessed by any class. This could be abused to create Person objects with arbitrary values.
Solution: Limit the visibility of the method to only those classes that need to use it. Consider using the 'private' or 'protected' access modifiers.

Vulnerability: CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
Issue: The function person4Parameters takes in untrusted inputs and uses them directly. This can be exploited to manipulate the application's behavior.
Solution: Always distrust input. Implement input validation and sanitization measures to ensure that the input is safe to use. Consider using prepared statements or parameterized queries.

"""
Scenario 1: Test with valid name, age, and address

Details:
  TestName: testPersonWithValidParameters
  Description: This test is meant to check the Person object creation when valid name, age, and address are provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up valid name, age, and address parameters.
  Act: Invoke the person4Parameters method with the valid parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the Person object is created with the correct parameters. The significance of this test is to ensure that the method works correctly with valid parameters.


Scenario 2: Test with null name

Details:
  TestName: testPersonWithNullName
  Description: This test is meant to check the Person object creation when null name is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up null name, valid age, and address parameters.
  Act: Invoke the person4Parameters method with the null name parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if an appropriate exception is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that an exception is thrown when a null name is provided. The significance of this test is to check the method's error handling for null parameters.


Scenario 3: Test with negative age

Details:
  TestName: testPersonWithNegativeAge
  Description: This test is meant to check the Person object creation when negative age is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up valid name, negative age, and valid address parameters.
  Act: Invoke the person4Parameters method with the negative age parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if an appropriate exception is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that an exception is thrown when a negative age is provided. The significance of this test is to check the method's error handling for invalid age values.


Scenario 4: Test with null address

Details:
  TestName: testPersonWithNullAddress
  Description: This test is meant to check the Person object creation when null address is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up valid name, age, and null address parameters.
  Act: Invoke the person4Parameters method with the null address parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if an appropriate exception is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that an exception is thrown when a null address is provided. The significance of this test is to check the method's error handling for null parameters.
