================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The code does not contain any security vulnerabilities itself. However, if this code is part of a larger application where the value returned by the age() method is used in a GET request, it can lead to information exposure.
Solution: To prevent potential information exposure, avoid using sensitive data in GET requests. Instead, use POST requests or secure methods of transmitting data.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The age() method seems to return a hard-coded value, which might indicate it's a leftover from debugging. If this method is part of a larger application, it might lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Make sure to remove all debug code or guard it using debug flags that are off in a production environment.

Vulnerability: CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
Issue: If the method age() is used in a security decision, such as access control check, it can lead to security issues because it returns a hard-coded value. An attacker could potentially bypass the security check.
Solution: Never rely on hard-coded values for security decisions. Always use trusted and dynamic inputs.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to Validate Age Value

Details:
  TestName: validateAgeValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the 'age' method returns the correct value of 15.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the 'age' method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the expected value of 15.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify the correctness of the returned value from the 'age' method. The expected result is 15 because the 'age' method is hardcoded to return this value. The significance of this test is to ensure that the 'age' method is functioning as expected.

Scenario 2: Test to Validate Age Type

Details:
  TestName: validateAgeType
  Description: This test is meant to check if the 'age' method returns a value of type integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the 'age' method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check the type of the returned value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the 'age' method returns an integer. The significance of this test is to ensure that the 'age' method is returning the correct type of data.

Scenario 3: Test to Validate Negative Age

Details:
  TestName: validateNegativeAge
  Description: This test is meant to check if the 'age' method can return a negative value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the 'age' method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against a negative value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify the impossibility of the 'age' method returning a negative value. The expected result is a failed test because the 'age' method is hardcoded to return 15, which is a positive integer. The significance of this test is to ensure that the 'age' method cannot return invalid age values.

Scenario 4: Test to Validate Age Value After Modification

Details:
  TestName: validateAgeAfterModification
  Description: This test is meant to check if the 'age' method returns the correct value after modification is made in the code.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Modify the 'age' method to return a different value, then invoke the 'age' method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the new expected value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify the flexibility of the 'age' method to return different values. The expected result is a successful test with the new value. The significance of this test is to ensure that any changes made to the 'age' method are reflected in its returned value.
