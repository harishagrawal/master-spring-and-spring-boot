================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: The code does not include any database interaction or SQL queries, so there is no risk of SQL Injection vulnerabilities in this specific code snippet.
Solution: If database operations are added in the future, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to properly sanitize user input and prevent SQL Injection attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Issue: The code does not include any user input rendering or web output, so there is no risk of XSS vulnerabilities in this specific code snippet.
Solution: If user input is rendered in web pages in the future, properly encode or sanitize the input to prevent XSS attacks. Use well-tested libraries for output encoding.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Path Traversal
Issue: The code does not include any file system operations or path manipulations, so there is no risk of Path Traversal vulnerabilities in this specific code snippet.
Solution: If file system operations are added in the future, validate and sanitize user-supplied file paths to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive directories or files.

Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: The code does not include any random value generation or usage, so there is no risk of using insufficiently random values in this specific code snippet.
Solution: If random values are needed in the future for security-sensitive operations like session IDs or tokens, use a cryptographically secure random number generator (e.g., java.security.SecureRandom).

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Verify console output when left() is called

Details:
  TestName: leftPrintsExpectedOutput()
  Description: This test verifies that calling the left() method prints the expected output to the console.
Execution:
  Arrange: Capture the console output using a ByteArrayOutputStream and a PrintStream.
  Act: Invoke the left() method.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to compare the captured output with the expected string "left\n".
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the left() method correctly prints "left" to the console.
  This test ensures that the method behaves as expected and provides the correct output to the user.

Scenario 2: Verify no exceptions are thrown when left() is called

Details:
  TestName: leftDoesNotThrowExceptions()
  Description: This test verifies that calling the left() method does not throw any exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is needed.
  Act: Invoke the left() method within a try-catch block.
  Assert: Use assertThat with no expected exceptions to ensure no exceptions are thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the left() method does not throw any exceptions during execution.
  This test ensures that the method is stable and does not cause unexpected exceptions, contributing to the overall reliability of the code.

Scenario 3: Verify left() does not modify any class-level state

Details:
  TestName: leftDoesNotModifyState()
  Description: This test verifies that calling the left() method does not modify any class-level state.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the left() method.
  Act: Invoke the left() method on the instance.
  Assert: Use assertions to verify that any relevant class-level state remains unchanged after the method call.
Validation:
  The assertions verify that the left() method does not have any side effects on the class-level state.
  This test ensures that the method is purely focused on its intended functionality and does not introduce unintended modifications to the class state.

Scenario 4: Verify left() is accessible and can be called

Details:
  TestName: leftIsAccessible()
  Description: This test verifies that the left() method is accessible and can be called without any access restrictions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the left() method.
  Act: Invoke the left() method on the instance.
  Assert: Use assertTrue to verify that the method call completes successfully without any access-related exceptions.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the left() method is properly accessible and can be called without any access control issues.
  This test ensures that the method is correctly defined with the appropriate access modifier and can be invoked as expected.
