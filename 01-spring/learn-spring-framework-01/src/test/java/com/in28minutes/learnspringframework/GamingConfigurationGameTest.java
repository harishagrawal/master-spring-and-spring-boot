================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: If the application uses SQL databases and the code doesn't properly sanitize user input, it may be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
Solution: Use prepared statements with variable binding (parameterized queries) instead of building SQL queries manually.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: If the application is web-based and doesn't properly neutralize user input, it may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
Solution: Use proper output encoding when rendering user-supplied input.

Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: If the application doesn't implement proper authentication checks, unauthorized users may be able to access sensitive information or functions.
Solution: Implement proper authentication and authorization checks for all sensitive functions.

Vulnerability: CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
Issue: If the application transmits sensitive information in cleartext, it may be intercepted by unauthorized parties.
Solution: Use secure communication protocols like HTTPS to encrypt the transmission of sensitive information.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Game Instance Creation Test

Details:
  TestName: testGameInstanceCreation.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the game() method is creating a new instance of the PacmanGame class correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangements required as no parameters are needed for the game() method.
    Act: Invoke the game() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual type of the returned object against the expected type (PacmanGame).
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the game() method is creating a new instance of the PacmanGame class. If the returned object is indeed an instance of the PacmanGame class, it validates that the game() method is functioning as expected.

Scenario 2: Game Instance Non-Null Test

Details:
  TestName: testGameInstanceNotNull.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the game() method is returning a non-null object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangements required as no parameters are needed for the game() method.
    Act: Invoke the game() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned object is not null.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the game() method is indeed returning an object and not null. If the returned object is not null, it validates that the game() method is correctly creating a new instance of the PacmanGame class.

Scenario 3: Game Instance Unique Test

Details:
  TestName: testGameInstanceUnique.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the game() method is creating a unique instance of the PacmanGame class each time it is called.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangements required as no parameters are needed for the game() method.
    Act: Invoke the game() method twice.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the two returned objects for equality. They should not be the same.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the game() method is creating a new and unique instance of the PacmanGame class each time it is called. If the two returned objects are not the same, it validates that the game() method is functioning as expected.

	// The error seems to be related to the Java version used for compilation.
	// The error message suggests that the Java version 21 is not supported.
	// However, as of now, the latest stable release of Java is 17.
	// So, it seems there might be a configuration issue in the build file (pom.xml for
	// Maven project)
	// where Java version is set to 21 which is not yet available.
	// This is not an issue with the test cases or business logic. It's a configuration
	// issue.
	// The solution would be to set the Java version in pom.xml to a valid and available
	// version like 8, 11 or 17.
