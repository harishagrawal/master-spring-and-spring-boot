================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
Issue: The System.out.println() method is used to print out a static message. If this message is replaced with a variable or user input, there is a potential for improper handling or escaping of output, leading to vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or injection attacks.
Solution: Always sanitize and validate any user inputs. Use proper encoding or escaping methods when displaying output.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The System.out.println() method is used, which sends output to the console. This can potentially expose sensitive information in a production environment.
Solution: Avoid using System.out.println() in production environments. Use a secure logging mechanism that can mask or remove sensitive information.

Vulnerability: CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
Issue: The method 'right()' is public and if this method is part of a larger class or API, it may be accessible to other parts of the application or external entities. If the 'right()' method performs any critical operation, this can lead to unintended behavior or exploitation.
Solution: Ensure that methods are given the most restrictive access modifiers necessary. If 'right()' is not intended for use outside its class, consider making it private or protected.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to verify the right method is called successfully

Details:
  TestName: testRightMethodIsCalled
  Description: This test is meant to check if the "right" method is successfully called without throwing any exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: No data arrangement is required since the method doesn't take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the "right" method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that no exceptions were thrown during the execution.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method has been invoked successfully. The expected result is no exception thrown. The significance of this test is to ensure the method can run smoothly in the application.

Scenario 2: Test to verify the output of the right method

Details:
  TestName: testRightMethodOutput
  Description: This test is meant to check if the "right" method outputs the expected string "Shoot a bullet".
Execution:
  Arrange: Capture the output stream of the System.out.
  Act: Invoke the "right" method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the captured output against the expected string "Shoot a bullet".
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method outputs the correct string. The expected result is "Shoot a bullet". The significance of this test is to ensure the method behaves as expected in the application.

Scenario 3: Test to verify the right method does not modify any state

Details:
  TestName: testRightMethodStateUnchanged
  Description: This test is meant to check if the "right" method does not modify any state in the system.
Execution:
  Arrange: Capture the state of the system before the method call.
  Act: Invoke the "right" method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the system state before and after the method call.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method does not modify any system state. The expected result is no state change. The significance of this test is to ensure the method does not have any side-effects in the application.
