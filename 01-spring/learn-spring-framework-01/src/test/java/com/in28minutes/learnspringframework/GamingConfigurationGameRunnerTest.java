================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
Issue: The current code doesn't close resources properly after their usage. This can lead to resource leaks (like memory leaks) that can degrade system performance over time or make the system more susceptible to certain types of attacks.
Solution: Always close resources in a finally block or use try-with-resources block which automatically closes the resources at the end of the statement.

Vulnerability: CWE-470: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
Issue: This code doesn't validate the types of objects that are being passed to it. This could allow an attacker to pass malicious objects to the method, potentially leading to remote code execution or other types of attacks.
Solution: Always validate the types of objects that are being passed to your methods. This can be done using instanceof checks or by validating the class of the object.

"""
Scenario 1: Test gameRunner with valid PacmanGame instance

Details:
  TestName: testGameRunnerWithValidPacmanGame
  Description: This test is meant to check if the gameRunner method creates a valid GameRunner instance when provided with a valid PacmanGame instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new PacmanGame instance.
  Act: Invoke gameRunner method with the created PacmanGame instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned GameRunner instance is not null and that it's game property is the same as the PacmanGame instance that was passed in.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the gameRunner method correctly initializes a GameRunner object with the provided PacmanGame instance. This is crucial for ensuring the GameRunner correctly runs the provided game.

Scenario 2: Test gameRunner with null GamingConsole instance

Details:
  TestName: testGameRunnerWithNullGamingConsole
  Description: This test is meant to check if the gameRunner method throws a NullPointerException when provided with a null GamingConsole instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement required as we are passing a null instance.
  Act: Invoke gameRunner method with null.
  Assert: Assert that a NullPointerException is thrown.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the gameRunner method cannot be called with a null GamingConsole instance, ensuring that a game must be provided for the GameRunner to run. This is crucial for preventing runtime errors in the application.

Scenario 3: Test gameRunner with other valid GamingConsole instance

Details:
  TestName: testGameRunnerWithOtherValidGamingConsole
  Description: This test is meant to check if the gameRunner method creates a valid GameRunner instance when provided with a valid instance of a GamingConsole subclass other than PacmanGame.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of a GamingConsole subclass other than PacmanGame.
  Act: Invoke gameRunner method with the created GamingConsole instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned GameRunner instance is not null and that it's game property is the same as the GamingConsole instance that was passed in.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the gameRunner method correctly initializes a GameRunner object with any provided GamingConsole instance, not just PacmanGame. This ensures that the GameRunner is capable of running any game that extends the GamingConsole class.
