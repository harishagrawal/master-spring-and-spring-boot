================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The System.out.println statement is often used for debugging purposes and can lead to information leakage if left in production code.
Solution: Remove debug code or ensure it's properly managed using a logging framework like Log4J, which can be configured to disable debug statements in production.

Vulnerability: CWE-532: Information Exposure Through Log Files
Issue: If sensitive information is printed using System.out.println, it can be written to log files, leading to potential information exposure.
Solution: Avoid logging sensitive information. If necessary, use a secure logging mechanism that can mask or encrypt sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference
Issue: While not evident in the provided code, Java applications processing XML can be vulnerable to XXE attacks if not properly configured.
Solution: Ensure XML parsers are configured to disallow DTDs or at least disable external entities when parsing XML documents.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: Again, while not evident in the provided code, Java applications can inadvertently expose sensitive information through detailed error messages.
Solution: Ensure error handling is done properly, exposing minimal information to the user, and logging detailed error information server-side for review by authorized personnel.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to ensure that the method is working as expected

Details:
  TestName: testRightMethodFunctionality
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method "right" is functioning as expected. The test will check if the method successfully prints the message "right" to the console.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup or data is needed for this test as the method does not take any parameters or return any values.
  Act: Invoke the right method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the expected message "right" is printed to the console.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method is working as expected and printing the correct message to the console. This test is significant to ensure the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test to ensure the method is not throwing any unexpected exceptions

Details:
  TestName: testRightMethodForExceptions
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method "right" is throwing any unexpected exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup or data is needed for this test as the method does not take any parameters or return any values.
  Act: Invoke the right method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that no exceptions are thrown during the execution of the method.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method is not throwing any unexpected exceptions. This is important to ensure the robustness of the code.

Scenario 3: Test to ensure the method is not modifying any global variables or states

Details:
  TestName: testRightMethodForStateModification
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method "right" is modifying any global variables or states.
Execution:
  Arrange: Setup initial states or global variables.
  Act: Invoke the right method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the initial and final states or global variables to ensure they have not been modified.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method is not modifying any global variables or states. This is critical to ensure the integrity of the application's state.
