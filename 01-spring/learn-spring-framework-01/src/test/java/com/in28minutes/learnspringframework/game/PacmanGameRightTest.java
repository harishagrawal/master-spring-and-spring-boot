ROOST_METHOD_HASH=right_aad4baa51e
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=right_db5b14f884

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
Issue: The 'right()' method is declared as public, potentially allowing any code to invoke it. This could lead to unintended behavior or misuse of the function.
Solution: Assess if the 'right()' method needs to be public. If not, restrict its visibility to the minimum required scope, such as private, protected, or package-private. Apply the principle of least privilege.

Vulnerability: CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt
Issue: The code does not demonstrate the usage of any secure hashing mechanism for sensitive data. If the application handles passwords or other critical information, storing them without proper hashing and salting can lead to vulnerabilities if the data is compromised.
Solution: When storing sensitive information like passwords, use a secure one-way hashing algorithm with a randomly generated salt. Bcrypt, PBKDF2, or Scrypt are recommended choices. Avoid using weak hashing functions like MD5 or SHA-1.

Vulnerability: CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password
Issue: The provided code snippet does not contain any hard-coded passwords. However, it's important to ensure that the application does not use hard-coded passwords or sensitive information in the codebase.
Solution: If the application requires any passwords, API keys, or sensitive configuration data, store them securely using encryption or environment variables. Retrieve them dynamically at runtime. Regularly rotate and update these secrets.

================================================================================
Here are the JUnit test scenarios for the provided `right()` method:

Scenario 1: Verify console output

Details:  
  TestName: consoleOutputIsCorrect
  Description: This test verifies that the `right()` method prints the expected output to the console.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a ByteArrayOutputStream to capture the console output.
  Act: Invoke the `right()` method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the captured output against the expected string "right".
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly prints "right" to the console.
  This test ensures that the method's behavior aligns with the expected console output.

Scenario 2: Check method execution without exceptions

Details:  
  TestName: methodExecutesWithoutExceptions
  Description: This test verifies that the `right()` method executes without throwing any exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement required.
  Act: Invoke the `right()` method.
  Assert: Use JUnit's assertDoesNotThrow to ensure no exceptions are thrown during method execution.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the method runs successfully without any exceptions.
  This test helps identify potential issues or unexpected behavior that may cause the method to throw exceptions.

Scenario 3: Verify method return type

Details:  
  TestName: methodReturnsVoid
  Description: This test verifies that the `right()` method has a void return type.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement required.
  Act: Invoke the `right()` method.
  Assert: No assertions needed as the test will fail if the method does not have a void return type.
Validation:
  The absence of assertions confirms that the method has a void return type.
  This test ensures that the method signature adheres to the expected return type.

Scenario 4: Check method accessibility

Details:  
  TestName: methodIsPublic
  Description: This test verifies that the `right()` method has public accessibility.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement required.
  Act: Invoke the `right()` method from outside the class.
  Assert: No assertions needed as the test will fail if the method is not public.
Validation:
  The successful invocation of the method from outside the class confirms its public accessibility.
  This test ensures that the method can be called from other classes as intended.

Note: Since the provided `right()` method is relatively simple and doesn't have any parameters or complex logic, the test scenarios are limited. In real-world scenarios, more comprehensive test cases would be necessary to cover various input combinations, edge cases, and error handling.
