================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-215: Information Exposure Through Debug Information
Issue: The software may disclose sensitive information through debug messages.
Solution: Ensure no sensitive data is logged. If debug data needs to be logged, ensure the logs are appropriately secured.

Vulnerability: CWE-532: Information Exposure Through Log Files
Issue: The software writes sensitive information to a log file that can be read by unauthorized actors.
Solution: Ensure that any logs do not contain sensitive information. If logs must contain sensitive data, they should be appropriately protected.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test Normal Execution of Method Left

Details:
  TestName: testLeftMethodExecution
  Description: The purpose of this test is to check if the method executes without any errors and prints "Go Back".

Execution:
  Arrange: No preparation needed for this test since the "left" method does not have any input parameters.
  Act: Execute the method "left".
  Assert: Verify that the output equals "Go Back".

Validation:
  Confirmation will be done by checking whether the system prints "Go Back". This test verifies that the code is functioning correctly during regular operation.


Scenario 2: Test Method Invoked Multiple Times

Details:
  TestName: testMultipleInvokeOfLeftMethod
  Description: This test scenario will validate whether the "left" method can handle multiple invocations in a row.

Execution:
  Arrange: No preparation needed for this test since the "left" method does not have any input parameters.
  Act: Execute the method "left" multiple times.

Assert: Verify that the output equals "Go Back" for each and every method call.

Validation:
  This scenario is to test the durability of the function and to verify if multiple invocations have the same consistent output. Fulfiling this scenario ensures that the method can handle repeated invocations without any internal state affecting the outcome.


Scenario 3: Test Method Behavior For Interruptions

Details:
  TestName: testLeftMethodForInterruptions
  Description: This test is designed to simulate an execution interruption during the operation of method "left" to ensure that it will handle interruptions gracefully.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock interruption during the execution of the method.
  Act: Execute the method "left".
  Assert: Verify that the output equals "Go Back" after the mock interruption.

Validation:
  This test is intended to verify the method's ability to handle unexpected interruptions. The printed message should still display, and this is important for robustness and stability of the method, especially in a multi-threaded environment.
