================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
Issue: The System.out.println() method is used to print out a static message. If this message were to include user input or data from an untrusted source, it could lead to a potential output encoding vulnerability.
Solution: All user-controlled data should be properly sanitized and escaped before output. Use encoding libraries like OWASP Java Encoder for HTML or Java's URLEncoder for URL encoding.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The System.out.println() method is used, which sends output to the console. In a production environment, sensitive information printed to the console could be inadvertently exposed in logs.
Solution: Avoid logging sensitive information. If logging is necessary, use a secure logging library that can mask sensitive information, and ensure that access to logs is restricted.

Vulnerability: CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
Issue: The 'left()' method is public, which means it can be accessed from anywhere. If this method were to perform any sensitive operations, it could be misused.
Solution: Make methods private or protected wherever possible, and only expose the necessary methods as public. Always limit the scope of methods and variables to the minimum necessary.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to check if the method prints the expected message

Details:
  TestName: testPrintMessage
  Description: This test will check if the method left() is printing the expected message "Go back".
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as there are no parameters or dependencies.
  Act: Invoke the left() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the printed message with the expected message "Go back".
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the method is printing the expected message. The expected result is "Go back" since that's the hardcoded message in the method. This test ensures the functionality of the method is as expected.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the method prints any message

Details:
  TestName: testPrintAnyMessage
  Description: This test will check if the method left() prints any message at all.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as there are no parameters or dependencies.
  Act: Invoke the left() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that some message is printed.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the method is able to print any message. This test is important to ensure that the method is functional and able to print messages.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the method throws any error

Details:
  TestName: testMethodError
  Description: This test will check if the method left() throws any error.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as there are no parameters or dependencies.
  Act: Invoke the left() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that no errors are thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the method is error-free. This test is important to ensure that the method is working as expected without any runtime errors.
