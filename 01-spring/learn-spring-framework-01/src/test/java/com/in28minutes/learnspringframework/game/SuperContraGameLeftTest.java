================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
Issue: The code prints out a log message directly to the console. If this message includes user-provided input, it could lead to log injection attacks.
Solution: Always sanitize and validate user-provided input before logging. Consider using a logging library that automatically handles this.

Vulnerability: CWE-215: Information Exposure Through Debug Information
Issue: Printing debug information to the console in a production environment can expose sensitive information to potential attackers.
Solution: Avoid printing debug information in production code. Use a proper logging system and ensure log files are securely managed.

Vulnerability: CWE-532: Information Exposure Through Log Files
Issue: If the System.out.println statement contains sensitive information, it could be written to log files that might not be properly secured.
Solution: Never log sensitive information. Ensure that log files are written to a location that has appropriate access controls.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to check if the method prints the expected message

Details:  
  TestName: testPrintMessage
  Description: This test will check if the method left() is printing the expected message "Go back". 
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as there are no parameters or dependencies.
  Act: Invoke the left() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the printed message with the expected message "Go back".
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify if the method is printing the expected message. The expected result is "Go back" since that's the hardcoded message in the method. This test ensures the correct message is being printed.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the method prints any message

Details:  
  TestName: testPrintAnyMessage
  Description: This test will check if the method left() is printing any message at all. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as there are no parameters or dependencies.
  Act: Invoke the left() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if anything was printed to the console.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify if the method is printing anything. The expected result is true since the method should print a message. This test ensures the method is functioning and printing a message.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the method does not throw an exception

Details:  
  TestName: testDoesNotThrowException
  Description: This test will check if the method left() does not throw any exceptions. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as there are no parameters or dependencies.
  Act: Invoke the left() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that no exceptions are thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify if the method is throwing any exceptions. The expected result is that no exception is thrown as the method should just print a message. This test ensures the method does not fail unexpectedly.
