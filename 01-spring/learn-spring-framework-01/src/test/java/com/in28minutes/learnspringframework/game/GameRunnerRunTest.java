 * ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
 * Vulnerability: CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs Issue: The
 * System.out.println() function is used for logging which may lead to log injection
 * vulnerabilities. Attackers can inject malicious data into the logs and possibly impact
 * the functioning of the application. Solution: Use a secure logging library that can
 * sanitize or properly encode user-controlled data before logging.
 *
 * Vulnerability: CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check Issue: The code does
 * not perform any validation or integrity check before running the game. This can lead to
 * code integrity issues where an attacker could replace the game with malicious code.
 * Solution: Ensure to perform integrity checks such as checksum or digital signature
 * verification before running the code.
 *
 * Vulnerability: CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release Issue: The game is run
 * without a proper shutdown or release mechanism. This can lead to resource leaks which
 * can degrade system performance over time or lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
 * Solution: Ensure to implement a proper shutdown or release mechanism for the game, such
 * as calling a cleanup function when the game ends.
 *
 * ================================================================================
 * Scenario 1: Test for the correct execution of the method
 *
 * Details: TestName: testRunMethodExecution Description: This test is meant to check
 * whether the run method is executed correctly. The method should print the statement and
 * then execute the game's up, down, left, and right methods sequentially. Execution:
 * Arrange: Mock the game object and its methods: up, down, left, and right. Act: Invoke
 * the run method. Assert: Verify that the game's up, down, left, and right methods were
 * called once each. Validation: The assertion aims to verify that the run method executes
 * the game's methods as expected. It is significant to ensure that the game is
 * functioning properly when the run method is called.
 *
 * Scenario 2: Test for the correct sequence of method calls
 *
 * Details: TestName: testMethodCallSequence Description: This test is to check if the
 * methods up, down, left, and right are called in the correct sequence after the run
 * method is called. Execution: Arrange: Mock the game object and its methods: up, down,
 * left, and right. Act: Invoke the run method. Assert: Verify the sequence of method
 * calls: up, down, left, right. Validation: The assertion verifies that the methods are
 * called in the correct sequence. This is important as the sequence could affect the
 * game's performance or outcome.
 *
 * Scenario 3: Test for exception handling
 *
 * Details: TestName: testExceptionHandling Description: This test is meant to check how
 * the run method handles exceptions. For example, if one of the game's methods throws an
 * exception. Execution: Arrange: Mock the game object and its methods such that one of
 * them throws an exception. Act: Invoke the run method. Assert: Verify that the method
 * does not throw an exception and handles it gracefully. Validation: The assertion aims
 * to verify that the run method can handle exceptions properly. This is important to
 * prevent the application from crashing in case of errors during the game's execution.
