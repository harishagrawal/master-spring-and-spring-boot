================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The code is exposing the creation of an Address object with hard-coded values. If these values are sensitive, this could lead to a privacy violation.
Solution: Avoid hard-coding sensitive information directly into your code. Instead, consider using secure methods of storing and accessing sensitive data, such as environment variables or encrypted configuration files.

Vulnerability: CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference ('XXE')
Issue: If the Address object is serialized to XML for any reason, there may be an XML External Entity attack vector. This can lead to disclosure of internal files, denial of service, SSRF, or remote code execution.
Solution: Ensure that any XML parsing done in your application is configured to disallow the resolution of external entities.

Vulnerability: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
Issue: The code contains hard-coded credentials (Baker Street, London). If these are used for authentication purposes, an attacker who gains access to the code could use these credentials to gain unauthorized access to systems or data.
Solution: Remove hard-coded credentials and use a secure method to store and retrieve credentials, such as a secure, encrypted database or a secure, dedicated service for managing credentials.

Scenario 1: Validate Address Creation

Details:
  TestName: testAddressCreation.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the address object is created correctly with the given parameters. The target scenario is the successful creation of the address object.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement or setup is needed as the address method does not take any parameters nor does it depend on any external dependency.
  Act: Invoke the address method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual results (the created Address object fields) against the expected outcomes ("Baker Street", "London").
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the Address object is created correctly with the given parameters. The expected result is "Baker Street", "London" because that's the hardcoded values the method is returning.
  This test is significant as it verifies if the address method is correctly creating the address object.

Scenario 2: Validate Address Instance

Details:
  TestName: testAddressInstance.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the returned object from the address method is an instance of the Address class. The target scenario is the successful creation of the address object.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement or setup is needed as the address method does not take any parameters nor does it depend on any external dependency.
  Act: Invoke the address method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual results (the created Address object) against the expected outcome (an instance of Address class).
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the returned object is an instance of the Address class. The expected result is true because the address method should return an Address object.
  This test is significant as it verifies the type of the object returned by the address method.

Scenario 3: Validate Address Non-Null

Details:
  TestName: testAddressNonNull.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the address method returns a non-null object. The target scenario is the successful creation of the address object.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement or setup is needed as the address method does not take any parameters nor does it depend on any external dependency.
  Act: Invoke the address method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned Address object is not null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the returned object is not null. The expected result is a non-null object because the address method should return an Address object.
  This test is significant as it verifies that the address method does not return a null object.
